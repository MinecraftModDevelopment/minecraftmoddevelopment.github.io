Hello everyone, and welcome to MMD's fourth annual Spooky Jam! This is our fall celebration for the modded Minecraft community. During Spooky Jam members of our community create new mods that fit the spooky, dark, fall/autum seasonal theme. Participants are encouraged to challenge themselves and learn new skills. All of the newly created mods will be showcased by MMD and included in the Spooky Jam modpack and public server.

You can follow the event by joining the `#spookyjam` discord channel on the [MMD Discord server](https://discord.mcmoddev.com). Participants are also encouraged to use the [#SpookyJamMC](https://twitter.com/search?q=#spookyjammc&src=typd) tag on twitter to share their progress and updates.

## Jam Guidelines
The following list of guidelines are in place to provide a fair experience for all participating in the event. These guidelines are not strictly enforced however not following them may result in your project being excluded from certain aspects of the event.

1. Projects should be made between the 1st and 31st of October.
2. Teams are allowed. We recommend a limit of four members.
3. Submissions should fit the theme of Spooky Jam.

## Submissions
Submissions can be made by leaving a comment [here](https://gist.github.com/Darkhax/0abbabcef574799f9641879accc76a96) with the required info. While the deadline is the 31st of October we **highly recommend** submitting before the 21st of October. This will ensure that your project makes it onto the server and our modpack.

## Minecraft Server
We will be hosting a public server featuring the submissions for this event. Details on how to join this server will be made available at a later date.

### SpookyJam Festival
The SpookyJam Festival is a new mini event that will take place on the public server. This festival will feature several minigames and booths that highlight participating mods. The festival will open on the 21st of October.

## Additional Events

We highly encourage everyone to consider taking part in Digital Ocean's [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/) challenge. They will be giving out free limited edition shirts and sticker packs to anyone who signs up and creates four pull requests on GitHub. Contributing to SpookyJam submissions is a great way to support the community and complete the Hacktoberfest Challenge.

Additionally this year MMD is Sponsoring the [Modtoberfest Challenge](https://modtoberfest.com). The Modtoberfest Challenge is similar to Hacktoberfest however participants contribute pull requests to verified Minecraft Mod repos. Those who complete this challenge will recieve a free mega sticker pack featuring stickers from various community projects including MMD! 

## FaQ

**Can I be part of multiple teams?**    
Yes, you may be part of multiple teams.

**Can I submit multiple entries?**    
Yes, however spammed entries which are of very low quality may not be considered for the event.

**Can I use Fabric, Forge 1.12, or Bedrock edition?**    
While this is technically allowed we will not be considering entries other than those that support Forge 1.16.3 for our modpack and promotion. This is largely due to technical reasons. If you're interested in a Fabric fall festival we would recommend checking out [FallFest](https://modfest.net/fallfest/1.16/).

**Do open source contributions count as team members?**    
No, the team member limit only counts for people who are actively part of your team. 

**Can we have more than four team members?**    
The recommended team limit was put in place to help newer modders join teams. We will not be enforcing this as a rule however we recommend teaming up with people you haven't worked with before.

**I need help coming up with an idea?**    
Learning how to improve your own creativity is part of Spooky Jam's goal. Everyone has their own creative process and this is generally something you have to learn yourself. A few things which may help with inspiration is [/r/nosleep](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/), [/r/TwoSentenceHorror](https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoSentenceHorror/), [Cryptid Wiki](https://cryptidz.fandom.com/wiki/Category:Cryptids), [Terror.ca's random horror movie picker](https://terror.ca/movies/random), [Halloween](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halloween), and [Autumn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autumn). 

**Can I submit previous year's entries?**    
Yes, previous year entries that have been updated can be included in a limited capacity. We want to focus on promoting the new mods however previous submissions will be allowed in the modpack and server.

**Can I submit mods that have never been part of SpookyJam?**    
Yes, however this will be done on a case by case basis. We want to focus on promoting new submissions.
