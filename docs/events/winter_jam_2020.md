It's time for MMD's third anual WinterJam! It's starting to get rather cold here O_o This is our mod making event where participants are encouraged to create mods that fit a winter, festive, or new years theme. Festive can apply to any tradition, event, or ceremony that takes place during this time of year.

Participants and those following the event should use the [**#WinterJamMC**](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23winterjammc&src=typd) hashtag on twitter to talk about this event, or use the ``winterjam`` channel on the [MMD Discord server](https://discord.mcmoddev.com). We will also be using this hashtag to share update, and to help us find things to retweet.

## Guidelines
The following list of guidelines is in place to provide a fair experience for everyone.  
Not following these guidelines may result in your project being excluded from various rewards and/or promotions.

1. Projects should be made during the event, starting from the 16th of November and ending on the 16th of December.
2. Teams are allowed. We recommend keeping to a max of 4 members.
3. Submissions should make use of seasonal theme of the event.
4. All assets and code should be created during the event.
5. Submissions should run on a dedicated server without crashing.
6. Submissions should work with 1.16.4 and be compatible with the latest release of forge and MCP. (Community MCP mappings from gigaherz are fine)
7. You may use any library or dependency you want, but you are responsible for issues caused by those dependencies.
8. You may submit multiple entries, or participate on multiple teams.
9. Mod generators such as MCreator are not allowed. Tools which generate pieces of code, such as IDE tools or some modeling programs are fine.
10. Submissions should be visible source.

This event would usually start on the 1st of December and run until the 31st of December, however this year we have changed it based on community feedback to give mod makers and players who want to try the mods more time because of Christmas.

The new official start date for WinterJam is the [16th of November](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=MMD+WinterJam+2020+Start+Date&iso=20201116T00&p1=%3A) and ends on the [16th of December](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=MMD+WinterJam+2020+End+Date&iso=20201216T00&p1=%3A). We are using the UTC time zone for this event.

## Submissions
Submissions can be made by leaving a comment [here](https://gist.github.com/ProxyNeko/) with the requested info.

Submissions should be made before the **9th of December** to ensure that they will be added to the server. This will give us time to prepare the server and work out any server related bugs. Please ensure your submission is on CurseForge, has been reviewed, and is not alpha or experimental. We will be updating mods during the event so you can still submit updates later on.

Please check out #winterjam for further announcements and discussion!  

## Modpack/Server
Once the submissions date has been reached we will put together a modpack containing all the submissions that follow our guidelines. This modpack will be hosted on our event server where everyone is welcome to join and test out the new mods. In addition the modpack will also include previous submissions that have been updated to be compatible with our server. The inclusion of previous year submissions will be done on a request basis so if you author one or have one you want included make sure to request it's inclusion by contacting a staff member. (Preferably ProxyNeko or Darkhax)  

## Rewards
All participants who make a valid submission will recieve a 'WinterJam2020' role on Discord. This is a visual role that commemorates the event. Participating projects will also be promoted by MMD and included in our Winter Jam 2020 modpack.

Please note that any previous year entries will also be eligable for the role if they have added a substantial amount of new content to the mod during the event.
