# Staff Roles & Expectations 
- **Admins** - Admins are the ones making all of the top level decisions. If you have any questions, or want to arrange a partnership with MMD you should talk to them. Admins are expected to deal with public relations, and also make sure everyone is in line. That said they are not the dictators of MMD. 
- **Moderators** - Moderators help keep an eye on things. They are responsible for giving people the proper roles they need, and making sure everything runs smoothly. They are also responsible for answering questions about MMD, and making sure people are talking in the right place. 
- **Staff** - This role is for anyone who is considered part of the MMD staff. They will have a similar permission level to moderators, however they also maintain some other major project related to MMD, such as an official MMD server. While they can handle moderator stuff as well, that is not their primary purpose. 
- **Partner** - Partners are people from other servers and groups who have partnered with MMD. They serve as a representative of their group within MMD.

# Role Requirements
The MMD server has many roles which are meant for members of the general community. These roles are usually given out by moderators when certain conditions are met. To request one of the roles below you must familiarize yourself with the requirements and, unless otherwise noted, contact a moderator (@Moderators) in the #role-requests channel.

- **Modder** - This role is for anyone who has made a mod or plugin for Minecraft. It is expected that anyone requesting this role has some level of experience with programming, and has a mod or plugin already published. To get this role you must provide a link to a mod/plugin you have authored. There are no size/download count requirements, however you will be required to provide some verification in form of screenshot or any other form the moderator sees fitting. (Editing the description of the mod on CurseForge with a message for the staff is prefered but other options are avalable)
- **Streamer/YouTuber** - This role is for anyone who has a YouTube or livestream channel. There are no size requirements, however some level of continuous activity is expected.

# Warnings & Bans
The MMD server uses an infraction based system for handling warnings and bans. Moderators and admins can issue infractions to members. Each infraction has an associated point value, the higher the points the more serious the infraction is. The types of infractions available are split into major and minor categories. 

### Major - 3 points
- **EULA** - Given out when a member violates the Minecraft EULA, or promotes content that does. This includes sharing or authoring websites, servers, plugins and mods which violate the EULA. 
- **Illegal Content** - Given out when someone posts content which is illegal, or promotes illegal activity. As MMD servers are located in the United States, the laws of that country will be used as the basis. This includes copyright laws and computer misuse laws. 
- **Obscene Content** - Given out when someone posts content which is obscene. This includes sexually explicit content, and content which contains intense violence.
- **Unpermitted Bot** - Given out to bots which have not been cleared to join the server. This includes spam bots, self bots and general discord bots. This infraction will cause an automatic perm ban. 
- **Other** - This infraction can be given out for misc reasons. Moderators will be required to provide reasoning and evidence for this infraction, which will then be public for all members of staff. There is 0 tolerance for misuse of this infraction. 

Note that in cases where illegal activity is involved, the details for the poster should be [reported to Discord Trust and Safety directly](https://support.discordapp.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000291932-How-to-Properly-Report-Issues-to-Trust-Safety). 

### Minor - 1 point
- **Flame/Provoke** - Given out to members who make posts with the intention of provoking a negative reaction from other members.
- **Advertise** - Given out to members who try to take advantage of MMD to promote their own content. Exceptions are commonly given to this rule, for things like mod authors sharing their mods, or MMD partners. Please see the advertising policy for more info. 
- **Bot Abuse** - Given out to those who take advantage of a bot for malicious purposes. This does not include those who are testing the bot in the proper testing channel. 
- **Spam** - Given to those who send messages with no value. Things like spamming random characters.
- **Backseat/Mini Modding** - Given to members who act like a moderator or administrator without having the authority to do so. This does not cover situations where members are being helpful, such as directing others to the appropriate room for discussion. 
- **Malicious Conduct** - Given to members who behave in a manner which can cause distress, harm or inconvenience to the other members. This includes discrimination, bullying, hate speech, using multiple accounts to evade a ban/warning, doxxing, pinging without a proper cause and so on.
- **Unsuitable Name** - Given to members who have a name which is not suitable. These names include those which are insensitive, malicious or deceiving. This **should** be used for staff impersonation as well. 
- **Other** - This infraction can be given out for misc reasons. Moderators will be required to provide reasoning and evidence for this infraction, which will then be public for all members of staff. There is 0 tolerance for misuse of this infraction. 

### Infraction Policy
If a moderator feels that a member is deserving of an infraction, they can issue one of the pre-defined infractions. Infractions are created through a bot, which will require the staff member to include reasoning and evidence. Once the infraction has been completed, it will be entered into our system, and the member being infracted will be sent a direct message through the bot informing them of the infraction. Points will eventually expire, however they will remain in the database. 

If a member has 3 infraction points, they will be temporarily suspended from MMD. During the suspension period the admins will review the member's history and determine whether or not a ban is needed. Every further infraction will require invoke another admin review. 

There is zero tolerance for misuse of the infraction system. All infractions must include evidence of some sort. In cases where said evidence would be illegal to reproduce, other forms of verification such as 3rd hand testimonials are acceptable. 

Keep in mind that some members have weird ways of interacting with each other. Depending on the history between the two members, some interactions which are against the rules may be acceptable. An example of such an exception would be two friends provoking each other. 

# Advertisement
Using MMD as a platform to advertise content is not allowed. Exceptions to this policy are made for members who have some sort of relation with MMD. The first exception is made for MMD Partners. This group of people may make promotions and announcements in MMD, provided that they run things by an admin first. The second group of exceptions are for content creators who are recognized by MMD, and are posting in the designated channels. For example, modders are allowed to show off their new mods in `#community-announcements`. It is important to note that there is a difference between answering questions or having a conversation about another project, and a promotion or advertisement post. 

# Channel Policy
MMD currently allows members to request new channels to be created. We are also still allowing people with archived channels to reactivate theirs. While anyone can request a channel, this is typically reserved for mod authors and those with projects that need a place for discussion. The channel list is sorted alphabetically where possible, when adding and reactivating channels staff members should be sure they are added to the right place. All user channels should go in the "Community Mods" category unless otherwise stated.

PLEASE NOTE: Channel owners are allowed to manage their own permissions, *however*, certain permissions are globally disabled on MMD and should *not* be re-enabled for *anyone*, including yourself, on user channels. Anyone found re-activating or using a prohibited permission may have their channel removed and an infraction added to the channel owner or owners. Prohibited permissions are as follows, and subject to change:

 * Mention Everyone
 * Manage Channel
 * Sync Permissions (This will break your channels permissions)

In addition, changing the permissions for Staff, Moderators, or MMD Admins is prohibited, as is changing your channel category. Violations of these rules may lead to having your channel removed and an infraction added to the channel owner or owners.

If a user channel is inactive for 30+ days, a staff member will send a message asking the channel owner to contact staff within 7 days. If they do not contact staff within that time frame the channel will be archived.
