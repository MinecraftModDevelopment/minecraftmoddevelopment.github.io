Respect Discord's Terms of Service:You're on discord. Respect their rules which can be found [here](https://discord.com/terms).
Try to keep messages in the proper channels:We understand that staying on topic is hard, but please at least try. Channel topics exist for a reason, it helps keep the server organized.;nMoreover, spam is not tolerated.
Try to speak English:The common language in this server is English. We however understand that not everyone is as good at English, so you may use translation tools if you need to.
Try to solve your issues in public channels:Modding questions and/or requests _will not_ be answered in DMs.;nMake sure to ask people (preferrably with a ping) before DMing them or sending them a friend request.
Do not promote illegal activity:This includes piracy, cheating, or any breach of Minecraft's [EULA](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/eula) or similar documents.
Keep pings to a minimum:Only ping people when needed (before sending DMs for example).;nMoreover, if people ask you to turn off ping replies, make sure to do so!
Ping staff roles when needed:Pinging a staff role is more beneficial than pinging specific members, resulting in actions taken faster.
Don't ask to ask:Please just ask questions; don't test the waters for the real question. Instead, ask the full question so that others can better understand what you need, rather than creating an atmosphere of assumptions and discouraging people from wanting to help.;n[More Information](https://solhsa.com/dontask.html)
No invite links:Please send invite links only when asked for, or when approved by a moderator beforehand. This appliess especially to request and announcement channels.

Please keep in mind that the opinions and views expressed by staff of MMD do not necessary reflect the opinions and views of MMD as a whole. Remember, we are individuals, who are not in any way obligated to help you with issues that do not involve the MMD server itself. Also, do not confuse MMD staff with the people who develop MMD mods! There is certainly some overlap, but that does not mean that a member of one knows anything about the other.

Have a nice stay here. See you around!
